			<h1> What is our goal?</h1> 
		<font size="4"><p>Our company's goal is to create autonomous robots who can perform manual labor tasks for you. These tasks are nearly endless and these robots are designed to save money in the long run.</p></font>
			<h1> Who is our target?</h1>
			<font size="4"><p> Our target age range for these butler robots are between 30-50 and 65 and up. We expect that some seniors will be quite interested in our idea as it would save them money in their retirement. They would be getting higher quality service for a cheaper rate. We also expect for people with current butlers to invest in our product as withing 2 years they would already be saving money.</p></font>
			 <h1> What is our market size?</h1>
			<font size="4"><p>Our market size is around 200 people. We got this estimate because we believe that only the very rich could afford our product. Other people who might also want to purchase our product are seniors with large retirement funds. </p></font>
