<h2> <ul> 

	<li> Our robot has a total cost of $100,000. The hardware costs a total of $90,000 because we use ultra lightweight yet strong titanium for our robot. Our software cost 100,000$. </li> <br>
	<li> We moved our office space from USA to India because the office space there is way cheaper than in the USA, also we hire local skilled workers from India and we pay them a good amount of money to encourage workers to work here and attract more workers to work for our company. Because of the high salery we pay to them, they will become the top 1% of the entire India. </li> <br>
	<li> Our target of first year is to advertise and hopefully sell some robots in order to attract some more customers, also we only have 20 staff so we can only sell a little amount of robot, in this case is 5, but we can still earn a fair amount of money.</li> <br>
	<li> Even though our price of robot is very very high, it will still attract a lot of customers because if the costumers use our robot for 4 years, it will be cheaper than hire a butler for you to work (in this case butler's annual salery is 50,000$ per year).</li> <br>
	<li> In the future, our company will only sell a limited amount of robot per year, but each year we are increasing the amount we make a bit, so more customers will buy it and we can make more profit.</li> <br>
