					<p class="grey"> 0-10: Children in this age range will not buy our product because they do not have money for this. <br />
								   10-20: Children and teens in this age group would not be interested in something like this, and even if they were, their parents would likely pay for it. <br />
								   20-30: In this age group, a few rich entrepreneur pet owners may be interested in this, so we put 0.01%. <br />
								   30-40: Adults in this age would be mildly interested in this product because they won't be as tired or available as perhaps a fifty year old. As a result we put 0.03%. <br />
								   40-50: Adults in this age group have higher paying jobs and have children who want pets but do not take care of them, so they need something to do it for them when they are at work, so we put 0.07% <br />
                                   50-60: Adults in this age group are starting to enter retirement, and have less money to spend on expensive robots. However, they still love their pets and, with their children moved out, have only their animal friends for companionship. For this age group we put 0.1%. <br />
                                   70-Death: Adults in this age group are not very interested in technology but can be very connected to pets, it is also to hard to take care of them </p>
