			<p style="color:orange;">The Elite has been modified and followed suggestions by athletes and now we are proud to present the official release of The Elite Smartwatch. The Elite isn't just like any other smartwatch. The Elite is designed for the people who want to reach goals beyond what is thought to be unachievable. The elite isn't just for trying to train to achieve the same goal everyday, but to go faster, longer, and better than you ever have before. You can easily time yourself for running a distance and compare your speed averages with friends and compete. You may also contact Team8theelite@gmail.com and you may submit your suggestions and we will be willing to make changes to the current software.</P>
