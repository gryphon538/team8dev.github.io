				<p>For the number of Units, we choose to sell 200 because it seemed like a reasonable goal. For the next 2 years we know that our company will grow, so we will manufacture more of our product.</p>
				<p>We started with $1,000 a robot, but our company would loose money. So we thought either we make more products (which would be too costly), or we could make the product slightly better and sell it at a reasonable price ($2,000).</p>
				<p>We got the total cost by adding up all our expenses.</p>
				<p>As you can see, the expenses for HW (hardware) keeps on going up because each year we make more of The Elite.</p>
				<p>The expenses for SW(software) also keeps on going up because each year, we will be making more products.</p>
				<p>We expect to expand our office space each year so obviously, the price will go up.</p>
				<p>We pay the staff more and more each year because we expect to profit over the years.</p>
				<p>Every year, since we have more money, we can spend more money on advertising.</p>
