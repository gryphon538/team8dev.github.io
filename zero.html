    <h4>What is Zero Robotics?</h4>
    <p>Zero Robotics is an annual robot programming competition run by MIT that inspires students to test their engineering and leadership skills. Every year a unique game is released and teams of up to twenty students have one month to write a program that competes against opposing robots. Programs are fully autonomous and are designed to run on SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites) which run on the International Space Station. This yearâ€™s game is called SpySpheres and points are scored by facing the opposing SPHERE and taking pictures of them. Additional game elements include points packs which give bonuses to teams with fast movement, energy which limits game actions, and defensive mirrors that block incoming pictures.

    <h4>Who are we?</h4>
    <p>Paly Zero is a rookie Zero Robotics team that seeks to encourage software, critical thinking, leadership and gracious professionalism within its members. Every week, fifteen members spread across programming, business, web, and project management get together to plan, design, and code our Zero robot. Our Zero team is split into three subteams: Autonomous for decision making and general implementation, Motion for optimized open or closed loop motion and rotation, and Strategy for macro-level game plans and scouting. In the qualification round for 2015 SpySpheres Paly Zero placed 51st, moving on to the semifinal round.

    <h4>Working with Paly Zero</h4>
    <p>Paly Zero offers a unique set of skills and opportunities to members of our alliance. Being a FIRST Robotics team we have extensive experience in autonomous control as well as optimized motion. This year we coded an open loop control system on our FIRST Robot that dynamically adjusted motor voltage to minimize the change in acceleration over time, which reduces jerky motion. We also have a strong strategic base that can scout opposing alliances and determine strategies to counter and adapt to their behavior. Finally we are very open to communication and will be nearly always be available to speak through email, phone, or video conference. Being a rookie team we have a lot to learn and are eager to work with more experienced teams. To contact Paly Zero email Zero captain at jonathanzwiebel[at]gmail[dot]com</p>
