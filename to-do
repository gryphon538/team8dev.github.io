We've decided that what's currently on github (Alex's website) will be the site we modify.


This is a list of everything we need to change, add whatever you want to this list:

Beautify header - Rafi finished
Shrink logo - Rafi finished
Make blue box less corny - Rafi finished
Flatten buttons
Get rid of purple 'already visited' links
Get "Sponsor Us" button to work
Decide on what content we're going to put on the website
Customize CSS more
