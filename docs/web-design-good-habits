Web Design Good Habits:
  no "12-columns"
  don't have duplicates for flexibility - use "small-12 large-6 columns"
  good descriptive commits, not "Update index.html"
  always put things in rows & columns
  don't have rows class and no columns class
  close all tags, including <p> and <div> !
  go in and tab everything so you can catch extra tags
