# Team Website

## Overview:
This is the repository for the official Team 8 website. If you want to report a bug, you should create a new issue on the repo and post it on the #web channel on slack. Push to master to deploy.

## How to View:
Clone the repository. Download Ruby (2.7.8, newer versions like 3.2 won't work.) Then download Jekyll, a framework we use. Using terminal, cd into the repository. Download bundler. Run bundle install. Then type in `bundle exec jekyll serve`. Open up Google Chrome and type localhost:4000 in the search bar.
