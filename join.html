    <h3>So you want to join the robotics team...</h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes our robotics team different from other teams is that we don't force a class and anybody can join. The only thing we ever really enforce is safety. That's in a different section of this site.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But anyhow, if you're a Paly student and are interested in making science, by all means join! "Science isn't about why, it's about why not!" -Cave Johnson, Portal 2
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our meetings are always on Thursdays right after the school ends with a little hangout session during advisory for those who don't have it.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also available on the club day with our booth on the quad.
      <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you join, check with one of the captains or with the mentor to get yourself on the mailing list too. And like our <a href="facebook.com/PalyRobotics">Facebook page</a>! <a href="twitter.com/frc8">Twitter</a>'s cool too, right?
      <br />
