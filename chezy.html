    <h4>Information</h4>
    <p>Chezy Champs is an off-season competition from Saturday, August 30 to Sunday, August 31st, hosted by the Team 254 (Bellarmine College Preparatory). Team 254 graciously invited teams throughout the bay area to apply for Chezy Champs, and after reading through team applications (including information about robot performance, awards won, and other criteria), 38 teams were selected to compete.</p>
    <br />
    <p>After Paly robotics was selected , we decided to open up this experience to incoming freshmen, and invited them to join us at Chezy Champs in San Jose on the last day of competition. This exciting day includes the final qualification matches and the following elimination matches. Team 8 faired quite well during our qualification matches this past season in April at the Silicon Valley Regional, and we.ve got high hopes to make it even further this time.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Besides the thorough schedule we.ve filled with opportunities for freshmen to explore, Team 8 will also be organizing transportation to and from the event, as well as pre-ordering lunch for everyone joining us. We.ll be giving out permission forms out during Thursday, August 21 and Friday August 22. You can also download the forms at <a href="/assets/docs/chezy_champs_permission_slip.pdf">this link</a>.</p>
