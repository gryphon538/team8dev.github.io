    <p>Paly Alto High School's robotics team will be hosting a tech camp for middle and elementary schoolers. The camp will be held in a single one week session from August 3rd to August 7th. From 8:45 am to 3:15 pm, students will learn to build and program small robots and even aquire skills to succeed in 3D animation. Snacks will be provided but packed lunches are required. We hope to spark interest and start future high schoolers on a path of engineering and technology. In order to keep costs minimal, we ask our students to donate 200 dollars.</p>
