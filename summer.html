    <p>Palo Alto High Schhool Robotics will be hosting a summer camp for middle schoolers (incoming 6th to incoming 9th) this year.  The camp will be held in a single week session from August 3rd to August 7th.  Beginning at 9:00 am until 3:00 pm everyday, students will gain experience in the fields of build, programming, CAD/3D Printing and 3D animation.  We hope to spark interest and start future high schoolers on a path of engineering and technology.  In order to keep costs minimal, we ask for a donation of $200 per camper.</p>
