    <h4>This year's game</h4>
    <p>In this year's game, Ultimate Ascent, robots attempt to throw frisbees. In the first stage, robotics autonimously try to score goals by shooting frisbees into goals. In the second stage, robot handlers use remotes to shoot more frisbees into the goals. In the final stage, the robots try to climb a ladder / monkeybar type structure. The team is scored by how many goals they make and how high they climb the structure.</p>

    <h4><a href="sponsors.html"><font color="#000000">FIRST</font></a></h4>
    <p style="font-size:15px">For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology was created in 1989 by Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers to inspire youth into science, engineering, and technology. Their main plan is to promote a philosophy of teamwork and collaboration amongst students and young engineers. From here, Gracious Professionalism is derived.</p>
