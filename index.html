    <h4>This year's game</h4>
    <p>In this year's game, Ultimate Ascent, robots attempt to throw frisbees. In the first stage,<span title="Robotics is a noun, this isn't just our mistake"> robotics </span>autonimously try to score goals by shooting frisbees into goals. In the second stage, robot handlers use remotes to shoot more frisbees into the goals. In the final stage, the robots try to climb a ladder / monkeybar type structure. The team is scored by how many goals they make and how high they climb the structure.</p>
