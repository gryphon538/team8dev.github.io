    <h4>FIRST</h4>
    <p>The Paly Robotics team is happy to have been a part of FIRST for 18 years. <span title="aka FIRST">For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology has a term "gracious professionism" that we believe everyone should abide by. It is the act of sharing with your competitors because you understand that the point of competition is to get better, and that to achieve that goal we need to help each other.
