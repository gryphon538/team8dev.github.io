    <h3>So you want to join the robotics team...</h3>
    <p>
      What makes our robotics team different from other teams is that we don't force a class and anybody can join.
      If you're a Paly student and are interested in making science, by all means join!
      "Science isn't about why, it's about why not!" -Cave Johnson, Portal 2

    <p>
      Our meetings are always on Thursdays right after school ends, with a little hangout session during advisory for those who don't have it.
      We are also available on Club Day with our booth on the quad.

    <p>
      Once you join, check with one of the captains or with the mentor to get yourself on the mailing list too. And like our <a href="http://facebook.com/PalyRobotics">Facebook page</a>! <a href="http://twitter.com/frc8">Twitter</a>'s cool too. In order to attend any FIRST event, you must also register for a <a href="https://my.usfirst.org/stims/site.lasso">STIMS</a> (Student Team Information Management System) account. Returning members who already made a STIMS account must have their parents check their email for instructions to access the consent form. Questions: See the <a href="/contact"> Contact Us Page </a>.
