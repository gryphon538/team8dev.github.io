    <!-- About joining our team -->
    <h3>So you want to join the robotics team...</h3>
    <p>
      What makes our robotics team different from other teams is that we don't force a class and anybody can join.
      If you're a Paly student and are interested in making science, by all means join!
      "Science isn't about why, it's about why not!" -Cave Johnson, Portal 2

    <!-- How to join the team -->
    <p>
      Our meetings are always on Thursdays right after school ends, with a little hangout session during advisory for those who don't have it.
      We are also available on Club Day with our booth on the quad.
    </p>

    <!-- What to do after you join -->
    <p>
      Once you join, check with one of the captains or with the mentor to get yourself on the mailing list. You can also sign up with our form on the <a href="/resources">page</a>. Also, like our <a href="http://facebook.com/PalyRobotics">Facebook page</a>! <a href="http://twitter.com/frc8">Twitter</a>'s cool too. In order to attend any FIRST event, you must also register for a <a href="https://my.usfirst.org/stims/site.lasso">STIMS</a> (Student Team Information Management System) account. Returning members who already made a STIMS account must have their parents check their email for instructions to access the consent form.
