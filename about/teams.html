      Easily the best team.  Daily work output comparible to that of a small nuclear power plant, if someone('s chair) hasn't turned off Rafi's computer.  Headed by Alex, who seems to think his scarf is an eyepatch and "dress up as pirate day" is every day.</p>

      The Web Team's goal for the year is to craft (haha Minecraft referance) a website better than Gunn's, which can be located <a href="error.html" title="Don't look at it. It will make you puke.">here</a>.

      Voted the "coolest" team for the past <b title="We all blame it on Rafi">7</b> years running, the Build team is in charge of building...the Robot (Bet you would have never guessed)!  They use drills, bandsaws, electric treetaps, 2x4s, glitterglue, fiberglass, iron rods, bolts, tree nuts, duct tape, oven mitts, cheese grater, erectronics, and empty bottles of unknown alcoholic semiliquids to build a (very sketcghy) FRC "approved" robot.  Sample blueprint <a href="http://xkcd.com/689/">here</a>.</p>
