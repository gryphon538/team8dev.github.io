      Web team designs and builds the websites that Paly Robotics uses includding this one. Web team uses many tools such as Ruby, Jekyll and Foundation to constantly improve the look of the website. In an average 3-hour session, all members of web team combined migh change the font of their site, but that's pretty optimistic.

      Voted the "coolest" team for the past 7 years running, the Build team is in charge of building...the Robot (Bet you would have never guessed)!  They use drills, bandsaws, electric treetaps, 2x4s, glitterglue, fiberglass, iron rods, bolts, tree nuts, duct tape, oven mitts, cheese grater, erectronics, and empty bottles of unknown alcoholic semiliquids to build a FRC "approved" robot.</p>
