    <h4 align="center">Web</h4>
    <p>
      Easily the best team, Web is in charge of coding websites, mostly this one.  Daily work output comparible to that of a small nuclear power plant, if someone('s chair) hasn't unplugged Rafi's computer.  This team is led by Alex <span title="le sweg hamr">"le sweg"</span> Tarng, who uses his head scarf as an eyepatch and seems to think "Dress up as Pirate Day" is every day.

    <h4 align="center">Build</h4>
    <p>
      Voted the "coolest" team for the past 7 years running, the Build team is in charge of building...the Robot (Bet you would have never guessed)!  They use drills, bandsaws, electric treetaps, 2x4s, glitterglue, fiberglass, iron rods, bolts, tree nuts, duct tape, <span title="Three iron ingots and 6 wires, arranged vertically in three columns, wires to the outside, iron to the inside.">solenoids</span>, oven mitts, cheese graters, erectronics and empty bottles of unknown alcoholic semiliquids to build a (very sketchy) FRC "approved" robot.</p>

    <h4 align="center">Leadership</h4>
    <p>
      The Leadership team meets on Tuesdays during lunch to discuss 'Leadership', a task not easily divined from the team's name.  Ironically, the <span title="I hear that they are still recruiting; you can email them at funkypickle99@gmail.com">"Communists' Collective Club"</span> also meets Tuesdays during Lunch and, even more ironically, leads better than our Leadership team.</p>

  <div class="hide-for-small large-6 columns">
    <h4 align="center">Animation</h4>
    <p>
      Voted the second most useful team, behind PR, Animation uses computers to manipulate pictures of blobs on a screen.  Apparently, if you get enough of these so-called 'pictures', and flash them fast enough in front of someone's face, it looks like they are moving and telling a story. Most people just get a headache.</p>

    <h4 align="center">PR</h4>
    <p>
      In charge of 'Public Relations'. They especially enjoy documenting the web team<span title="FTL!"> messing around </span>during the Saturday 'work' sessions.  They threaten to show these photos to our <span title="No!  Not le hemr!">leaders</span>; however, it is in my humble opinion that the web team should be allowed to <span title="cough cough Andrew and Spencer">slack off</span> once in a while; after all, <span title="AND we abuse semicolons! AND we don't close <p> tags!">we DID write this excellent, unbiased content!</span>
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="hide-for-small large-6 columns">
    <h4 align="center">Programing</h4>
    <p>
      Uses computators to write instructions for the robot, telling it what to to, and whom to chuck frisbees at.  Unfortunently, in a miscommunication between the programing and build teams, the robot refuses to interpret any code not written in <span title="No no no it's C++">C</span>.
