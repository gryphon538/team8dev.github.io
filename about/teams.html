    <p>
      Easily the best team, Web is in charge of coding websites, mostly this one.  Daily work output comparible to that of a small nuclear power plant, if someone('s chair) hasn't unplugged Rafi's computer.  This team is led by Alex 'Le Swag', whom uses his head scarf as an eyepatch and seems to think "Dress up as Pirate Day" is every day.

    <h4 align="center">Build</h4>
    <p>
      Voted the "coolest" team for the past 7 years running, the Build team is in charge of building...the Robot (Bet you would have never guessed)!  They use drills, bandsaws, electric treetaps, 2x4s, glitterglue, fiberglass, iron rods, bolts, tree nuts, duct tape, oven mitts, cheese grater, erectronics, and empty bottles of unknown alcoholic semiliquids to build a FRC "approved" robot.</p>
