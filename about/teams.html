    <h4 align="center">Web</h4>
    <p>
      Easily the best team, Web is in charge of coding websites, mostly this one.  Daily work output comparible to that of a small nuclear power plant, if someone('s chair) hasn't unplugged Rafi's computer.  This team is led by Alex <span title="Le Swag Hammer!">'Le Swag'</span>, whom uses his head scarf as an eyepatch and seems to think "Dress up as Pirate Day" is every day.

    <h4 align="center">Build</h4>
    <p>
      Voted the "coolest" team for the past 7 years running, the Build team is in charge of building...the Robot (Bet you would have never guessed)!  They use drills, bandsaws, electric treetaps, 2x4s, glitterglue, fiberglass, iron rods, bolts, tree nuts, duct tape, oven mitts, cheese graters, erectronics, and empty bottles of unknown alcoholic semiliquids to build a (very sketchy) FRC "approved" robot.</p>

    <h4 align="center">PR</h4>
    <p>
      The PR teams meets on Tuesdays during lunch to discuss 'Public Relations', a task not easily divined from the team's name.  Ironically, the <span title="I hear that they are still recruiting; you can email them at funkypickle99@gmail.com">"Communists' Collective Club"</span> also meets Tuesdays during Lunch and, even more ironically, has a larger sphere of influence than our PR team.</p>

  <div class="small-6 large-6 columns">
    <h4 align="center">Animation</h4>
    <p>
      Voted the second most useful team, behind PR, Animation uses computers to manipulate pictures of blobs on a screen.  Apparently, if you get enough of these so-called 'pictures', and flash them fast enough in front of someone's face, it looks like they are moving and telling a story. Most people just get a headache.</p>
