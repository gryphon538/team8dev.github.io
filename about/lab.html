    <p>To be able to build our robot, we have our lab. In this place we are able to learn to effeciently collaborate as well as learn to use power tools and how to code. It is managed and organized by our lab managers [enter lab managers names here], and we work hard to keep it clean. We know to appreciate our luck that we live in a town where parents and organizations <a href="/sponsor.html">donate</a> to pay for a place like this (we thank those who have donated on our <a href="/about/sponsors.html">sponsors page</a>. Visitors are welcome, and can recieve maps and instructions on how to get here on the <a href="/resources/visitor.html">resources page</a>. Anyways, enjoy the pictures and thanks for checking us out!</p>
