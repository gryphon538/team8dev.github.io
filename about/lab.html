    <p>Our lab, managed by Claire Kokontis, is divided into three sections: the cage, the Java shop and the yard. The cage is where we construct most of our robot. Here, members of the build team can be found constructing the parts for our robot. One can also find various tools including but not limited to a laser cutter, a CNC mill, and a drill press. The cage is managed by Eric Griswold. The Java shop houses the majority of our computers. Here, the programming team works on writing code for the robot. The web team also built this website in the Java shop. The yard is our outdoor facility where we can assemble and store large parts of our robot. The shop also has a state of art table saw for cutting large pieces of wood. The shop is managed by James. Thanks for donating to keep our lab up to date. Enjoy the pictures and thanks for checking us out.</p>

<!-- maybe write some script that fetches photos through numbers so they don't have to all be entered? can use orbit slider -->
