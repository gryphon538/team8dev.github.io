    <h4>Build</h4>
    <p>
      The build team is responsible for designing and building the robot. Members create robot elements by utilizing a variety of professional grade equipment. In addition, Build Team members need to specialize in CAD, electronics, metalworking, and pneumatics.

The build team utilizes state of the art equipment to construct the parts of the robot. Due to the danger of the machinery, all build team members are required to take a safety test to prove their competence at handling such tools. Several examples of machinery used frequently by the build team are the chop saw, the drill press, the CNC mill, and the laser cutter. Of course, at times students will resort back to the classic hammer and nails.
