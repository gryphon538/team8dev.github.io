    <h4>Build</h4>
    <p>
      The build team is responsible for designing and building the robot. Members create robot elements by utilizing a variety of professional grade equipment. In addition, Build Team members need to specialize in CAD, electronics, metalworking, and pneumatics.

The build team utilizes state of the art equipment to construct the parts of the robot. Due to the danger of the machinery, all build team members are required to take a safety test to prove their competence at handling such tools. Several examples of machinery used frequently by the build team are the chop saw, the drill press, the CNC mill, and the laser cutter. Of course, at times students will resort back to the classic hammer and nails.

    <h4>PR</h4>
    <p>
     The Public Relations team is responsible for representing the entire robotics team, and maintaining a good working environment. Members make presentations, create newsletters, apply for awards, and raise money from sponsors. By communicating with successful technological companies such as Google, DreamWorks, and Microsoft, PR obtains the funds necessary to support the robotics team.s ability to build robots and to attend competitions. By creating videos, taking pictures, and writing documentations of robotic achievements, PR makes team 8 eligible for awards such as the Chairman.s award, a nationally recognized award for aspiring high school robotics teams.

    <h4>Programing</h4>
    <p>
      The programming team writes the code  for the system on which the robot will operate. The language used to program the robot is C++, one of the most well-known languages in the world. The programming team members are given the challenge of creating not only an automatic, but also a manually controlled robot to participate in the competition. To collectively share the codes, the members use GitHub. They also have to collaborate with the Build Team to make their code compatible with the robot.s hardware. Web team, a subgroup of the programming team, mainly focuses on creating and editing the paly robotics website.

    <h4>Animation</h4>
    <p>
      The animation team uses Autodesk 3D animation software to. Reade short videos.  Members mainly focus on creating an animation to compete in FIRST'S annual competition.
