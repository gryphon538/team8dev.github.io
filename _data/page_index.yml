sponsors_description: Our robotics team needs money to be able to thrive, and for this reason we depend on our gracious sponsors. We welcome donations of all amounts. To view our sponsors check out our <a href="/about/sponsors" title="Under the &ldquo;About&rdquo; tab">Sponsors</a> page.

beliefs: Our team is focused on learning new skills, which includes leadership, teamwork, and the overall team experience. We are a completely student-run team and whatever the finished product might be, it is always a result of students. work, not mentors. Not many teams can say that. Other teams might think of winning as having a trophy by the end of the competition, but our version of winning can be failure.
