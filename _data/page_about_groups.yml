  name: Build
  description: The Build Team is in charge of &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; building the robot! Thanks to Team 8's plethora of tools, such as a laser cutter, CNC mill, drill press, and chop saw, Build Team members are able to construct the robot from the bottom up! Due to the potentially dangerous nature of construction, all of our Build Team members have passed a comprehensive safety exam.

  name: Programming
  description: Without programming, a robot would be no more than a very fancy, very large paper weight. It is the Programming Team's job to write the code, transforming our robot from a static hunk of metal to an advanced, competent machine. Using C++, the Programming Team works in tandem with the Build Team in order to make the robot competition ready, coding for both autonomous running as well as through human controllers.

  name: Lab Management
  description: Team 8's Lab Manager runs things in the lab during work days. Looking for a tool? Ask the Lab Manager. Wondering where you can find the Programming Captain? Ask the Lab Manager.  Lab Management is what keeps the lab from dissolving into chaos, making sure everything is put away in its correct place, checking to see if people are wearing safety goggles in the cage, and keeping all of us rowdy roboticists under control.
