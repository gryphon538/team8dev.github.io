# for usage on the mini-class page

text: At robotics, one of our goals to is to pass on our knowledge to younger students. One way we do this is by teaching mini-classes. At robotics, students sign up to teach other students a robotics-related topic. This allows students to teach other students what they feel they know best. Students are also encouraged to ask robotics veterans to teach a mini-class on a subject they wish they knew better. During sign-ups, students sign up for classes whose subjects they wish to learn. A list of mini-classes, and their times, are to the below.
