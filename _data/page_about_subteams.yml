  name: Build
  description: The Build Team is in charge of &mdash; you guessed it &mdash; building the robot!  The Build Team takes a design and makes it a reality, thanks to Team 8's plethora of tools, including a lathe, CNC mill, laser cutter and 3D printer.  In addition to machining, Build Team members learn about topics such as robot wiring and pneumatics systems, bringing all of this knowledge to help create the final product.

  name: Design
  description: Good design is key to developing a successful robot, and this is the job of the Design Team.  Design Team leads the team in prototyping, allowing different mechanisms and ideas to be tested out.  After determining which prototypes work the best, Design Team creates a computer-aided design (CAD) of the robot before it is built.

  name: Programming
  description: Without programming, a robot would be no more than a very fancy, very large paper weight. It is the Programming Team's job to write the code, transforming our robot from a static hunk of metal to an advanced, competent machine. Using Java, the Programming Team works in tandem with the Build Team in order to make the robot competition ready, coding for both autonomous running as well as through human controllers. The Programming Team uses Git in order to collaborate on code with its large development team.
