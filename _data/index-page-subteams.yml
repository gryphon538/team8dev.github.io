  paragraph: Good design is key to developing a successful robot, and this is the job of the Design Team. Design Team leads the team
        in prototyping, allowing different mechanisms and ideas to be built and tested out. After determining which prototypes
        work the best, Design Team creates a computer-aided design (CAD) of the robot before it is built.

  paragraph: The Build Team is in charge of — you guessed it — building the robot!  The Build Team takes a design and makes it a reality,
        thanks to Team 8's plethora of tools, including a lathe, CNC mill, laser cutter and 3D printer. In addition to machining,
        Build Team members learn about topics such as robot wiring and pneumatics systems, bringing all of this knowledge to
        help create the final product.
Software:

  paragraph: Writing code in Java and Python, the Software and Scouting Team works alongside Build Team to test our robot and make it functional. In addition to autonomous and human control of the robot, they code features such as computer vision and a dashboard to display the robot status during matches. They are also responsible for developing applications for data collection and analysis. We publish our projects here&#58; <a href="https://github.com/team8" target="_blank" class="paragraph-links">www.github.com/team8</a>.
