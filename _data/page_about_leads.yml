  bio: Lauren Nolen, a dedicated member of Paly Robotics, started her career in the lab as a rising Freshman at Palo Alto High. Originally in build team, she wasn't satisfied with her impact on the team and thought she could benefit the team in other ways. Frequently attending leadership meetings despite her inexperience, she soon became the epicentre of funding and public relations between Team 8 and countless businesses around the community.

  bio: Since I began doing 3d animation in 6th grade, I've always wanted to work with others to create beautiful animations, and through the animation team I got to do just that. Even when I was leading it, I still felt it wasn.t quite enough, so I blew it up into the art team we have now. Outside of that art team I escape into the beautifully crafted worlds in games and continue to develop my 3-D modeling skill to prepare myself for bigger and better projects.

  bio: Abducted by aliens at 3 months old, Sandy Crammond spent his first 12 years of life traveling with the renowned interstellar space-cowboy group known as the "galactic star slingers". As he explored the galaxy, he acquired a countless number of skills, such as hydra slaying, giga-beetle wrangling, and tomachi dueling. At twelve he was returned to earth, along with his trusty clone Tom, who is convinced he's the real Sandy. This year Sandy chose to put his skills to the ultimate test by doing one of the most feared jobs of the generation: project managing the Robotics team. His success in the area has already brought upon him excessive amounts of fame, and it is sure that he will live through the generations at first as history, and eventually legend.

  email: rlong [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: When Rafi Loing joined robotics, he wasn.t sure what team to join, as every job was something that he loved doing. So, of course, he joined Web. Max Bernstein taught him, along with his few peers, the way of Jekyll and Unix, and explored the dark, hidden, corners of Git. Over time all of them progress to be where they are now, until Rafi was the only one still on web team. He became captain earlier this year, and now works on learning how to manage a team.

  role: Treasurer

  email: lbrownell [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: Lydia Brownell is a sophomore and has been on the team about two years. She began as a build team member, and still actively participates in the build team, but has expanded into the newly created role of treasurer. She loves being on Team 8 because she has built model cars and planes since she was 8 years old and tinkered with legos even earlier than that; robotics is the next step. Robotics has also taught her very useful leadership skills, as well as given her many awesome friends who also care just as much about robotics and the traditions of Paly Robotics.
