Originally in build team, she wasn.t satisfied with her impact on the team and thought she could benefit the team in other ways. Frequently attending leadership meetings despite her inexperience, she soon became the epicentre of funding and public relations between Team 8 and countless businesses around the community.

  bio: Since Griffin began doing 3d animation in 6th grade, he always wanted to work with others to create beautiful animations, and through the animation team I got to do just that. Even when he lead the team he felt it wasn.t quite enough, so he blew it up into the art team we have now. Outside of that art team he escapes into the beautifully crafted worlds in games and continue to develop his 3-D modeling skills to prepare myself for bigger and better projects.

  name: Rafi Long
  email: rlong [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: When Rafi Loing joined robotics, he wasn.t sure what team to join, as every job was something that he loved doing. So, of course, he joined Web. Max Bernstein taught him, along with his few peers, the way of Jekyll and Unix, and explored the dark, hidden, corners of Git. Over time all of them progress to be where they are now, until Rafi was the only one still on web team. He became captain earlier this year, and now works on learning how to manage a team. In his free time he continues to enjoy playing Minecraft, reading, and coding.

  role: Treasurer

  name: Lydia Brownell
  email: lbrownell [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: Lydia Brownell is a sophomore and has been on the team about two years. She began as a build team member, and still actively participates in the build team, but has expanded into the newly created role of treasurer. She loves being on Team 8 because she has built model cars and planes since she was 8 years old and tinkered with legos even earlier than that; robotics is the next step. Robotics has also taught her very useful leadership skills, as well as given her many awesome friends who also care just as much about robotics and the traditions of Paly Robotics.
