  bio: Lauren Nolen, a dedicated member of Paly Robotics, started her career in the lab as a Freshman at Palo Alto High. Originally in build team, she wasn't satisfied with her impact on the team and thought she could benefit the team in other ways. Frequently attending leadership meetings despite her inexperience, she soon became the epicentre of funding and public relations between Team 8 and countless businesses around the community.

  role: Web Captain

  name: Rafi Long
  email: rlong [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: When Rafi Long joined robotics, he wasn't sure what team to join, as every job was something that he loved doing. So, of course, he joined Web. Max Bernstein taught him, along with his few peers, the way of Jekyll and Unix, and explored the more hidden parts of Git. Over time all of them progress to be where they are now, until Rafi was the only one still on web team. He became captain earlier this year, and now works on learning how to manage a team. In his free time he continues to enjoy playing Minecraft, reading, and coding.

  role: Treasurer

  name: Madeline Li
  email: mli [at] palyrobotics [dot] com
  bio: The treasurer joined Paly Robotics her freshman year, during the middle of build season. As she was swept into the tornado or tsunami or some-great-Earthly-crisis of Team 8, there was no time to officially put her on a sub-team, but the treasurer decided that that was fine and worked odd-jobs where she was needed. The matter of which sub-team the treasurer belongs to is still a mystery, a migraine-inducing topic, and another story. Near the end of build season, the previous treasurer, now design captain, Lydia, who was looking for a minion to succeed her, spotted the current treasurer and decided that she had found her minion. The treasurer also has a name Madeline.
