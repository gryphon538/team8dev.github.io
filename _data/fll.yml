  paragraph1: Paly Robotics is committed to inspiring an interest in STEAM in younger generations. As part of our commitment, we actively work to establish FIRST Lego League teams around our local area.
  paragraph2: <a target="blank" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll">FIRST Lego League Challenge</a> (FLL Challenge) is a robotics competition for middle school students (grades 4 - 8). Guided by two or more adult coaches, FLL Challenge teams (up to 10 members) research a real-world problem related to the yearly topic and create an innovative and creative solution to address it. Teams also are challenged to create a Lego robot using LEGO Mindstorms which can complete challenges for points. Teams are given a chance to compete their robot against other teams and present their project to judges at competitions, which occur towards the end of the year and run into the beginning of the next year. At the same time they learn “Core Values” by working in a team and learning leadership skills.
  paragraph3: Existing teams looking for mentorship from Paly Robotics, as well as students who are looking to participate in FLL but do not have a team, should fill out <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdG5EdXIyWl3NyUbUtX0am0Xe31V32DeaBvrErWDJOwpsbU4w/viewform">THIS</a> form.
