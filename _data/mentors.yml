        role: Head Mentor
        description: >
            Coming to the Bay Area from HoF Team 2834, which Ed Law founded and coached, as a mentor, he complements our student-run philosophy by prioritizing student learning. His advice has helped Team 8 distinguish the “needs” versus “wants” and make informed decisions regarding robot mechanism prioritization. He also provided directions for outreach and strategy to grow in the long term, helping create a “Five Year Plan” to map out future outreach initiatives. To further sustainability and success in the long run, Mr. Law encouraged recent alumni to transition into mentors, fostering a team culture of giving back and continuing the cycle of mentorship.

            Mr. Barbera is a Palo Alto High School alumni from the class of '79, who now looks at RF and Microwave technology in defense electronics, satellite communications, outdoor WiFi, and electric vehicle charging stations as a Systems Engineer at ChargePoint Inc. After his son joined Team 8 in 2016, he saw how much he could do for the lab and machine shop in terms of workspace improvements, and decided to help out the team. One of his favorite memories with us is working with the pit team on the new portable pit. Mr. Barbera's time on Team 8 has brought members tons of knowledge on the newly acquired equipment. His vision for team 8's future is one where it continues the tradition of Gracious Professionalism, teamwork, innovation, and enthusiasm that make his mentor experience inspiring.
