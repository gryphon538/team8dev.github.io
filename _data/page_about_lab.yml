text: The Paly Robotics Lab, managed by the lab manager, is divided into three sections; the cage, the Java Shop and the yard. The cage is where we construct most of our robot. Here, members of the build team can be found constructing the parts for our robot. One can also find various tools including but not limited to a laser cutter, a CNC mill, and a TIG welder.  The Java Shop houses the majority of our computers and is used for most team meetings.  The Web Team also updates this website in the Java Shop. Last is the yard, the outdoor facility where we assemble large parts of our robot and store extra material.  Here, one can find a miter saw and table saw, two machines we use heavily while prototyping.
