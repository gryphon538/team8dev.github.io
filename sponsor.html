    <p>Sponsors are what makes Paly Robotics possible. We take no money from our high school, so all of our activities are covered by grants and private sponsorship. We accept donations from private enterprises and families, but also encourage companies to sponsor the team. Our sponsors gain many benefits, such as logo placement on robots and the website, sponsorship plaques, and a tax deduction.</p>
