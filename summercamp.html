    <p>Palo Alto High School Robotics will be hosting a summer camp for middle schoolers (incoming 6th to incoming 9th) this year. The camp will be held in three sessions, one week each. The dates are July 18-22, July 25-29, and August 1-5. We hope to spark interest and start future high schoolers on a path of engineering and technology. Sign ups will open on January 22 (subject to change). More info on classes offered and cost will be coming soon.</p>
