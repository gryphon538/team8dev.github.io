	<b>More than Robotics</b></br>
	When most people think about robotics, they picture machines that are controlled by computers to complete certain tasks.  While building robots is a big part of what we do, our team is much more than that.  Besides building and programming the robot, we have different sections of the team that focus on things such as public relations, art, and student leadership.  At the camp, we will teach campers about all the aspects of the team.
	</br></br><b>Counselors</b></br>
	Our team members will be teaching campers about STEAM and about the different things that we do on the robotics team.  Just as we were taught what we know from older high school students, we hope to be able to teach what we have learned to the younger generation.  Student autonomy is a big part of our teamâ€™s philosophy, and we think that the best way to learn is by experience.
	</br></br><b>Paly Robotics Summer Camp 2015</b></br>
	Last year was the first year in a long time that we hosted a summer camp, and it went very well.  Because of the interest in the camp, we have revamped our sessions this year to accommodate more students and focus on more specific aspects of what we do.<p>

    <div class ="small-12 centered columns">
      <p style = "text-align:center"><b>Is previous experience required?</b></p>
      <p style = "text-align:center">Not at all.  We hope to introduce all campers to STEAM regardless of what they already know.  If they have previous experience, that is totally fine, and we will be sure to keep them engaged with interesting activities.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>Where do the donations for the camp go?</b></p>
      <p>The donations are handled by the Palo Alto High School Robotics Boosters, which is the non-profit entity that supports the team.  The boosters fund every aspect of the team, from creating the robot to paying for competitions.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>Since it is a donation to a non-profit, can I receive a tax deduction?</p></b>
      <p style="text-align:center">Yes, absolutely!  The Paly Robotics Boosters will send a receipt with the tax ID number.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>Will there be adult supervision?</p></b>
      <p style="text-align:center">Although the team is run primarily by students, we have mentors and coaches who will be there to supervise the summer camp at all times, just as they would do during normal team lab hours.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>How is safety going to be enforced when using tools/machinery?</p></b>
      <p style="text-align:center">Our team members are well versed in safe operation of all the machines and tools in the lab, but again, adults will be present to keep an eye on campers as well.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>What is the policy regarding lunch and snacks?</b></p>
      <p style="text-align:center">Campers will have to bring their own lunch, but we will be providing nut-free snacks to campers during breaks.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>Where is the robotics lab?</b></p>
      <p style="text-align:center">More information will be sent before the camp, but you can find the location of our lab on the Resources page.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>For incoming freshmen, does attending the camp affect the chance of being on the team the next year?</b></p>
      <p style="text-align:center">We cannot promise anything, but membership will be decided based on interest and commitment to the team.</p>
