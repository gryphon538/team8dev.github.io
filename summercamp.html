      <p>This year, Paly Robotics will be hosting our annual summer camp for incoming middle school students (incoming 6th - 9th). We hope to spark interest and start future high school students on a path in science, technology, engineering, art or math (STEAM).

	<b>More than Robotics</b></br>
	When most people think about robotics, they picture machines that are controlled by computers to complete certain tasks. While building and programming robots is a big part of what we do, our team is much more than that below the surface.  We have different sections of the team that focus on things such as art, public relations, and student leadership, to name a few.  Through the different sessions offered, campers will be able to experience what makes our team more than just robotics.  To learn more about the sessions offered and pick the right session(s) for your camper, check out the Sessions page.
	</br></br><b>Counselors</b></br>
	Student mentoring is a big part of our teamâ€™s philosophy and, and we rely on passing down knowledge from the older students to the younger students.  Reflecting this philosophy, our high school team members will be teaching campers about STEAM through the different aspects of the robotics team. Just as we were taught by older team members, we hope to be able to teach what we have learned to the younger generation.
	</br></br><b>Paly Robotics Summer Camp 2015</b></br>
	Last year was the first year in a long time that we hosted a summer camp, and it went very well. Because of the interest in the camp, we have revamped our sessions this year to accommodate more students and focus on more specific aspects of what we do.  To learn more about the different sessions offered and pick the right session(s) for your camper, head over to the Sessions page.</p>

      <p><b>Robot Design and Hardware</b></p>
      <p>In the Robot Design and Hardware session, campers will experience the process of hardware engineering, from the designing phase all the way to manufacturing and assembly. Campers will learn how to work with others and explain their ideas to create a useful and mechanically sound design to complete a specific challenge. Afterwards, trained counselors will assist campers in the use of tools to safely bring their design to fruition.</P>

      <p><b>Programming and 3D Animation</b></p>
      <p>In the Programming and 3D Animation session, campers will work in Python to learn the basics of programming. There will be an introductory programing group for those without experience, as well as an advanced group for those who are already familiar with software. Additionally, campers will learn to make and animate 3D models using Autodesk Maya, a professional piece of software used by some of the biggest animation companies, including Pixar.  By the end of the camp, campers will have created final projects which they will be able to bring home.</p>

      <p>In the Entrepreneurship and Web Design session, campers will learn how to take a business idea from start to finish; learning the skills to pitch their business ideas to potential investors. Furthermore, campers will learn how to create websites with languages such as HTML and CSS to showcase their business ideas, using GitHub to keep track of changes in a group environment.</p>

      <p style = "text-align:center"><b>Is previous experience required?</b></p>
      <p style = "text-align:center">Not at all.  We hope to introduce all campers to STEAM regardless of what they already know.  If they have previous experience, that is totally fine, and we will be sure to keep them engaged with interesting activities.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>Where do the donations for the camp go?</b></p>
      <p style = "text-align:center">The recommended donations ($350/week) are handled by the Palo Alto High School Robotics Boosters, which is the non-profit entity that supports the team. The boosters fund every aspect of the team, from covering summer camp costs to paying for the robot components and competitions.  Your donation is highly appreciated.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>Since it is a donation to a non-profit, can I receive a tax deduction?</p></b>
      <p style="text-align:center">Yes, absolutely!  The Paly Robotics Boosters will send a receipt with the tax ID number.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>Will there be adult supervision?</p></b>
      <p style="text-align:center">Although the team is run primarily by students, we have mentors and coaches who will be there to supervise the summer camp at all times, just as they would do during normal team lab hours.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>How is safety going to be enforced when using tools/machinery?</p></b>
      <p style="text-align:center">Our team members are well versed in safe operation of all the machines and tools in the lab, but again, adults will be present to keep an eye on campers as well.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>What is the policy regarding lunch and snacks?</b></p>
      <p style="text-align:center">Campers will have to bring their own lunch, but we will be providing nut-free snacks to campers during breaks.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>Where is the robotics lab?</b></p>
      <p style="text-align:center">More information will be sent before the camp, but you can find the location of our lab on the Resources page.</p>
      <br></br>
      <p style="text-align:center"><b>For incoming freshmen, does attending the camp affect the chance of being on the team the next year?</b></p>
      <p style="text-align:center">We cannot promise anything, but membership will be decided based on interest and commitment to the team.</p>
